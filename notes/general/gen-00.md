title: "General ML Notes"
---

These notes provide a comprehensive foundation in machine learning concepts, combining theoretical understanding with practical intuition. The material is drawn from StatQuest videos and Cornell's CS4780 course, two excellent resources for learning ML.

## Purpose and Goals

These notes aim to help you:

1. **Understand the fundamentals**: Build a solid foundation in statistics and probability before diving into ML algorithms
2. **Develop intuition**: Learn not just the "how" but the "why" behind each technique
3. **See connections**: Understand how different algorithms relate to each other
4. **Apply knowledge**: Gain practical insights for implementing these methods

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Statistics**: Sampling, probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals—the foundation for all ML
2. **Decision Trees**: Intuitive tree-based models that recursively partition the feature space
3. **Gradient Boosting**: The powerful technique of combining weak learners into a strong ensemble
4. **XGBoost**: The industry-standard implementation of gradient boosting with key optimizations
5. **Clustering**: Unsupervised techniques for discovering structure in unlabeled data
6. **Support Vector Machines**: Maximum margin classifiers with the kernel trick for non-linear boundaries
7. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA and t-SNE for handling high-dimensional data
8. **Regression**: From simple linear regression to logistic regression for classification

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should be comfortable with:

- Basic algebra and calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives)
- Linear algebra fundamentals (vectors, matrices, dot products)
- Basic probability concepts (events, conditional probability)

## How to Use These Notes

- Start with Basic Statistics if you need to refresh foundational concepts
- For each topic, focus on understanding the intuition before the math
- Pay attention to the "why" questions—understanding motivation helps retention
- Work through examples to solidify understanding

## Resources

- **StatQuest with Josh Starmer**: Excellent video explanations with clear visualizations
- **Cornell CS4780**: More rigorous treatment of machine learning theory
