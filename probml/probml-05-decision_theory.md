# Decision Theory

- Optimal Policy specifies which action to take for each possible observation to minimize risk or maximize utility
- Implicit assumption is that agents are risk neutral. 50 vs 0.5 * 100
- Zero-One loss: miss-classification rate in binary classifier
    - $l_{01}(y, \hat y) = I\{y \ne \hat y\}$
    - Optimal policy is to choose most probable label to minimize risk
        - $R(y | x) = p(y \ne \hat y | x) = 1 - p(y = \hat y | x)$
        - $\pi(x) = \arg \max p(y | x)$
    - In case the errors are cost-sensitive
        - FP is not same as FN
        - $l_{01} = c \times l_{10}$
        - Choose the label 1 if expected loss is lower:
            - $p0 \times l_{01} < p1 \times c \times l_{10}$
        - c will trade-off the decision boundary 
    - In case reject or abstain is also a possible action
        - Assume the cost of error $\lambda_e$
        - Assume the cost of rejection: $\lambda_r$
        - No decision when model confidence is below $1 - {\lambda_e \over \lambda _r}$

- ROC Curves
  - Summarize performance across various thresholds
  - Confusion Matrix
    - Give a threshold $\tau$
    - Confusion Matrix
          - Positive, Negative: Model Prediction
          - True, False: Actual Labels
          - TP, TN: Correct Predictions
          - FP: Model predicts 1, Ground Truth is 0
          - FN: Model predicts 0, Ground Truth is 1
      - Ratios from Confusion Matrix
          - TPR, Sensitivity, Recall
              - TP / (TP + FN)
              - Accuracy in positive predictions
          - FPR, Type 1 Error rate
              - FP / (FP + TN)
              - Error in Negative Predictions
  - ROC Curve is a plot between FPR (x-axis) and TPR (y-axis) across various thresholds
  - AUC is a numerical summary of ROC
  - Equal Error Rate is where ROC crosses -45 degree line.
  - ROC Curve is insensitive to class imbalance
      - FPR consists of TN in denominator
      - If TN >> TP, metric becomes insensitive to FPR
  - Precision-Recall Curves
      - The negatives are not model specific but system specific
      - For a search query, retrieve 50 vs 500 items.  (or tiles vs list)
      - Precision
          - TP / TP + FP
      - Recall 
          - TP / TP + FN
      - There is no dependency on TN
      - Precision curve has distortions. Smooth it out by interpolation.
      - To summarize the performance by a scalar
          - Precision @ K
          - Average Precision: Area under interpolated precision curve
          - mAP or Mean Average Precision is mean of AP across different PR curves (say different queries)
      - F-Score
          - Weighted harmonic mean between precision and recall
          - ${1 \over F} = {1 \over 1 + \beta^2} {1 \over P} + {\beta^2 \over 1 + \beta^2} {1 \over R}$
          - Harmonic mean imposes more penalty if either precision or recall fall to a very low level
          
  - Class Imbalance
      - ROC curves are not sensitive to class imbalance. Does not matter which class is defined as 1 or 0.
      - PR curves are sensitive to class imbalance. Switching classes impacts performance.
          - $P = {TP \over TP + FP}$
      - PR-AUC is more appropriate in case class imbalance
      - Multiclass problems can be treated as multiple binary classes. One class vs Rest.
      - Decision threshold calibration finds the optimal threshold for desired trade-off between precision and recall

- Regression
  - Metrics
      - Mean Squared Error: ${1 \over N} \sum (y - \hat y)^2$
      - Mean Absolute Error: ${1 \over N} \sum |y - \hat y|$
      - MAE is robust to outliers - proportional to regression with Laplace conditional distribution
      - MSE has simple calculus and proportional to regression with Gaussian conditional distribution 
      - Huber loss: MSE below cutoff, MAE above cutoff
      - Loss functions are usually calibrated with a proper scoring rule
      - Log score of the predicted density at the true value
  - Quantile Loss
      - Probability that value y is less than q quantile is q
      - $P(y \le y_q) = q$
      - Linear function with positive slope for over-prediction and negative slope for under-prediction
      - Slope depends on the quantile q

- Calibration
  - Property that predicted certainty of events match the frequency of their occurrence
  - Reliability Diagrams
      - x-asis: Predicted Probability
      - y-asis: Actual Probability

- Bayes Model Selection and Averaging
  - Bayesian approach to model selection
      - Choose $m \in M$ to maximize posterior $p(m|D)$
      - $p(m|D) \propto p(D|m)p(m)$
      - Use uniform prior over model classes
      - $p(D|m) = \int p(D|\theta,m)p(\theta|m)d\theta$
      - Integration over all possible parameter values
      - In practice, models might be compared using BIC or AIC
      - BIC approximates Bayes factor
      - AIC approximates Cross-validation

      - Maximizes predictive density of held out data
      - Approximating out-of-sample generalization
      - As trained model fits the training data
      - $AIC = -2LL + 2C$
      - LL is log-likelihood
      - C is number of parameters in the model
  
  - Bayesian Information Criteria
      - Biases in favor of simpler models
      - $BIC = -2LL + C\log N$
      - LL is log-likelihood
      - C is number of parameters in the model
      - N is the number of observations  

  - Minimum Description Length
      - Minimum number of bits needed to describe the model and the data
      - If we describe model in $L_1$ bits, and then describe the dataset using the model in $L_2$ bits. 
      - The MDL for the model is $L_1 + L_2$

  - Approximation of Bayesian Model Comparison
      - Integrated likelihood is analytically intractable
      - Approximate the integral by Laplace approximation
      - Uses 2nd order taylor expansion around MLE / MAP
      - The model is approximated as gaussian with constant determinant as n increases
      - AIC is an approximation of KL-Divergence between the the true model and a fitted model
      - Simple to compute
      - AIC = $2 \times \text{dof} - 2 \times LL$ (dof: degrees of freedom)
      - Sample error can result in overfitting
      - AIC_C: when sample size is small
          - AIC_C = AIC + ${2C(C+1) \over N-C-1}$
          - C is additional penalty for increasing number of parameters

  - Widely Applicable / Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion 
      - Penalizes models based on effective degrees of freedom
      - $C = 2 \times \text{dof}$

          - Difference between training error and test error
          - Generalization Gap
      - Regularized Risk
          - Add complexity penalty
          - $R_\lambda(f,D) = R(f,D) + \lambda C(f)$
          - Complexity term resembles the prior term in MAP estimation
      - Structural Risk
          - Empirical underestimates population risk
          - Structural risk minimization is to pick the right level of model complexity by minimizing regularized risk and cross-validation
