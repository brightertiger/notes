# Trees

- Recursively partition the input space and define a local model in the resulting region of the input space
    - Node i
    - Feature dimension d_i is compared to threshold t_i
        - $R_i = \{x : d_1 \le t1, d_2 \le t_2\}$
        - Axis parallel splits
    - At leaf node, model specifies the predicted output for any input that falls in the region
        - $w_1 = {\sum_{N} y_n  I \{x \in R_1\} \over \sum_{N}  I \{x \in R_1\}}$
    - Tree structure can be represented as
        - $f(x, \theta) = \sum_J w_j  I\{x \in R_j\}$ 
        - where j denotes a leaf node

- Model Fitting
    - $L(\theta) = \sum_J \sum_{i \in R_j} (y_i, w_j)$
    - The tree structure is non-differentiable
    - Greedy approach to grow the tree
    - C4.5, ID3 etc.
    - Finding the split
        - $L(\theta) = {|D_l \over |D|} c_l + {|D_r \over |D|} c_r$
        - Find the split such that the new weighted overall cost after splitting is minimized
        - Looks for binary splits because of data fragmentation
    - Determining the cost
        - Regression: Mean Squared Error
        - Classification:
            - Gini Index: $\sum \pi_ic (1 - \pi_ic)$
            - $\pi_ic$ probability that the observation i belongs to class c 
            - $1 - \pi_ic$ probability of misclassification
            - Entropy: $\sum \pi_{ic} \log \pi_{ic}$
    - Regularization
        - Approach 1: Stop growing the tree according to some heuristic
            - Example: Tree reaches some maximum depth
        - Approach 2: Grow the tree to its maximum possible depth and prune it back
    - Handling missing features
        - Categorical: Consider missing value as a new category
        - Continuous: Surrogate splits
            - Look for variables that are most correlated to the feature used for split
    - Advantages of Trees
        - Easy to interpret
        - Minimal data preprocessing is required
        - Robust to outliers
    - Disadvantages of Trees
        - Easily overfit
        - Perform poorly on distributional shifts

- Ensemble Learning
    - Decision Trees are high variance estimators
    - Average multiple models to reduce variance
    - $f(y| x) = {1 \over M} \sum f_m (y | x)$
    - In case of classification, take majority voting
        - $p = Pr(S > M/2) = 1 - \text{Bin}(M, M/2, \theta)$
        - Bin(.) if the CDF of the binomial distribution
        - If the errors of the models are uncorrelated, the averaging of classifiers can boost the performance
    - Stacking
        - Stacked Generalization
        - Weighted Average of the models
        - $f(y| x) = {1 \over M} \sum w_m f_m (y | x)$
        - Weights have to be learned on unseen data
        - Stacking is different from Bayes averaging
            - Weights need not add up to 1
            - Only a subset of hypothesis space considered in stacking

- Bagging
    - Bootstrap aggregation
    - Sampling with replacement
        - Start with N data points
        - Sample with replacement till N points are sampled
        - Probability that a point is never selected
            - $(1 - {1 \over N})^N$
            - As N â†’ $\infty$, the value is roughly 1/e (37% approx)
    - Build different estimators of these sampled datasets
    - Model doesn't overly rely on any single data point
    - Evaluate the performance on the 37% excluded data points
        - OOB (out of bag error)
    - Performance boost relies on de-correlation between various models
        - Reduce the variance is predictions
        - The bias remains put
        - $V = \rho \sigma ^ 2 + {(1 - \rho) \over B} \sigma ^2$
        - If the trees are IID, correlation is 0, and variance is 1/B
    - Random Forests
        - De-correlate the trees further by randomizing the splits
        - A random subset of features chosen for split at each node
        - Extra Trees: Further randomization by selecting subset of thresholds 

- Boosting
    - Sequentially fitting additive models
        - In the first round, use original data
        - In the subsequent rounds, weight data samples based on the errors
            - Misclassified examples get more weight
    - Even if each single classifier is a weak learner, the above procedure makes the ensemble a strong classifier
    - Boosting reduces the bias of the individual weak learners to result in an overall strong classifier
    - Forward Stage-wise Additive Modeling
        - $F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \beta_m f_m(x; \theta_m)$
        - $\beta_m, \theta_m$ are chosen to minimize the loss.
        - Add new models that address the residual error $r_i = (y_i - F_{m-1}(x_i))$
        - AdaBoodst
            - Classification with exponential loss: $L(y, F(x)) = exp(-yF(x))$
            - $y \in \{-1, +1\}$
            - Output of tree has to be {-1, +1} in each region
            - Each round m, the optimization is simplified to finding the best classifier fit to the weighted training data.
            - $\theta_m = \arg\min \sum w_i^{(m)} I \{y_i \ne f_m(x_i; \theta)\}$
    - Gradient Boosting
        - Fit the entire model in forward stagewise manner
        - $F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \beta_m f_m(x; \theta_m)$
        - Expand this as a Taylor series around $F_{m-1}(x)$
        - $L(y, F_m(x)) = L(y, F_{m-1}(x)) + g_m(x) + \beta_m f_m(x) + O(\beta_m^2)$
        - Neglect higher order terms
        - Minimize the loss
        - $f_m(x) = - g_m(x)$
        - $g_m(x) = {\delta L(y, F(x)) \over \delta F(x)}|_{F(x) = F_{m-1}(x)}$
        - The new predictor is trained to approximate the negative gradient of the loss
    - In the current form, the optimization is limited to the set of training points
    - Need a function that can generalize
    - Train a weak learner that can approximate the negative gradient signal
        - $F_m = \arg\min \sum (-g_m -F(x_i))^2$
        - Use a shrinkage factor for regularization
    - Stochastic Gradient Boosting
        - Data Subsampling for faster computation and better generalization

- XGBoost
    - Extreme Gradient Boosting
    - Add regularization to the objective
    - $L(f) = \sum l(y_i, f(x_i)) + \Omega(f)$
    - $\Omega(f) = \gamma J + {1 \over 2} \lambda \sum w_j^2$
    - Consider the forward stage wise additive modeling
    - $L_m(f) = \sum l(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + F(x_i)) + \Omega(f)$
    - Use Taylor's approximation on F(x)
    - $L_m(f) = \sum l(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i)) + g_{im} F_m(x_i) + {1 \over 2} h_{im} F_m(x_i)^2) + \Omega(f)$
        - g is the gradient and h is the hessian
    - Dropping the constant terms and using a decision tree form of F
    - $F(x_{ij}) = w_{j}$
    - $L_m = \sum_j (\sum_{i \in I_j} g_{im}w_j) + (\sum_{i \in I_j} h_{im} w_j^2) + \gamma J + {1 \over 2} \lambda \sum w_j^2$ 
    - Solution to the Quadratic Equation:
        - $G_{jm} = \sum_{i \in I_j} g_{im}$
        - $H_{jm} = \sum_{i \in I_j} h_{im}$
        - $w^* = {- G \over H + \lambda}$
        - $L(w^*) = - {1 \over 2} \sum_J {G^2_{jm} \over H_{jm} + \lambda} + \gamma J$
    - Condition for Splitting the node:
        - $\text{gain} = [{G^2_L \over H_L + \lambda} + {G^2_R \over H_R + \lambda} - {G^2_L + G^2_R \over H_R + H_L + \lambda}] - \gamma$
        - Gamma acts as regularization
        - Tree wont split if the gain from split is less than gamma

- Feature Importance
    - $R_k(T) = \sum_J G_j  I(v_j = k)$
    - G is the gain in accuracy / reduction in cost
    - I(.) returns 1 if node uses the feature
    - Average the value of R over the ensemble of trees
    - Normalize the values 
    - Biased towards features with large number of levels

- Partial Dependency Plot
    - Assess the impact of a feature on output
    - Marginalize all other features except k
