# Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning

- Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL): Leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data
  - Motivation: Labels are expensive, unlabeled data is abundant
  - Assumption: Underlying data distribution contains useful structure
  
- Data Augmentation
  - Creates artificial training examples through transformations
  - Preserves semantic content while changing surface features
  - Common augmentations:
    - Image domain: rotations, flips, color jitter, cropping
    - Text domain: synonym replacement, back-translation
    - Audio domain: pitch shifting, time stretching
  - Theoretical framework: Vicinical risk minimization
    - Minimize risk in local neighborhoods around training examples
    - Improves robustness and generalization
  
- Transfer Learning
  - Leverages knowledge from data-rich domains to improve performance in data-poor domains
  - Process:
    1. Pretrain model on large source dataset (e.g., ImageNet, Common Crawl)
    2. Adapt model to target task with smaller dataset
    3. Options for adaptation:
       - Feature extraction: Freeze pretrained layers, train only new head
       - Fine-tuning: Update all or subset of pretrained parameters
  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning:
    - Adapters: Small bottleneck layers added between frozen transformer blocks
    - LoRA: Low-rank adaptation of weight matrices
    - Prompt tuning: Learn soft prompts while keeping model parameters frozen

- Self-Supervised Learning
  - Creates supervisory signals from unlabeled data
  - Pretext tasks:
    - Reconstruction tasks: Autoencoders, masked language modeling
    - Context prediction: Predict arrangement of shuffled patches
    - Contrastive tasks: Learn similar representations for related inputs
  
  - Contrastive Learning
    - Learn representations by comparing similar and dissimilar examples
    - SimCLR framework:
      1. Generate two views of each image via augmentation
      2. Encode both views with shared encoder
      3. Apply projection head to map encodings to space for contrastive loss
      4. Contrastive loss: Maximize similarity between positive pairs (same image)
         and minimize similarity between negative pairs (different images)
      5. For downstream tasks, discard projection head and fine-tune encoder
    
    - Key challenges:
      - Hard negative mining: Finding informative negative examples
      - Batch size dependence: Performance scales with number of negatives
      - Feature collapse: Trivial solutions that ignore semantic content

  - Non-Contrastive Methods
    - BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent):
      - Teacher-student architecture with no negative examples
      - Student network predicts teacher network outputs
      - Teacher parameters updated via exponential moving average of student
      - Avoids collapse through asymmetric architecture and predictor networks
    
    - Masked Autoencoders:
      - Inspired by BERT's success in NLP
      - Mask significant portions of input (e.g., 75% of image patches)
      - Train encoder-decoder to reconstruct original input
      - For downstream tasks, use only encoder

- Practical Considerations
  - Pretraining often provides:
    - Better initialization for optimization
    - More generalizable features
    - Sample efficiency: Fewer labeled examples needed
  - Domain gap between pretraining and target task affects transfer effectiveness
  - Large pretrained models may contain useful knowledge but require careful adaptation
